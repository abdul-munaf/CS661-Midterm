## **Understanding The Dataset**
* This dataset provides information on the individuals killed during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the second intifada, which began in September 2000. The data has been meticulously collected and investigated by B’Tselem – The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.

* The dataset includes statistics on all human beings – Palestinians, Israelis, and foreign nationals – who lost their lives during this conflict. It provides details such as name, age, citizenship, date of death, gender, participation in hostilities, place of residence, type of injury, ammunition used, and more.

The columns provide specific information about each individual's death, including:

* **age:** Age of the individual.
* **citizenship:** Citizenship or nationality (e.g., Palestinian).
* **event_location:** The location of the event.
* **event_location_district and event_location_region:** More detailed geographic categorization of the event's location.
* **date_of_death:** The date on which the individual died.
* **gender:** Gender of the individual.
* **took_part_in_the_hostilities:** Whether the individual was involved in hostilities.
* **place_of_residence:** Where the individual lived.
